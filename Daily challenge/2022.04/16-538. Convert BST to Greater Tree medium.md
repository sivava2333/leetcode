[538. Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

+ The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
+ The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
+ Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# 2. Approach
## 2.1 Recursion
As a BST, all the nodes in the right subtree are greater than the root. So all we need to do is:
1. calculate the sum of right subtree
2. add the sum to the `root`
3. update sum by the value of root
4. do the same process with left subtree

+ Time complexity: O(n)
+ Space complexity: O(n)
> The space complexity of traversaling a binary tree is the height of the tree. The worst case in which the binary tree degenerates into linked list is n.

## 2.2 [Morris Traversal](https://github.com/sivava2333/leetcode/blob/main/Morris%20traversal/Morris%20traversal.md)  
It's a reversed in-order traversal (we can figure it out in the recursion approach : right -> root -> left).   
Just a little change :  
***Left pointer of most left node in right subtree points to current node***

+ Recursion
```
class Solution {
    private int sum = 0;
    
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        // base case : root == null
        if (root != null) {
            convertBST(root.right);
            sum += root.val;
            root.val = sum;
            convertBST(root.left);
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

class Solution {
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        int sum = 0;
        TreeNode cur = root;
        TreeNode mostLeft = null;
        while (cur != null) {
            mostLeft = cur.right;
            if (mostLeft != null) {
                while (mostLeft.left != null && mostLeft.left != cur) {
                    mostLeft = mostLeft.left;
                }
                
                if (mostLeft.left == null) {
                    mostLeft.left = cur;
                    cur = cur.right;
                    continue;
                } else {
                    mostLeft.left = null;
                }
            }
            
            
            sum += cur.val;
            cur.val = sum;
            cur = cur.left;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
